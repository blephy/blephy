# Welcome üòé !

My name is Allan, i have been developing since i was 13 years old, starting with VBScript, deploying my first web app in high school.

I followed a first university course to learn medicine for some years, then reoriented myself in the development of web applications. üòÅ

I am currently working at Posos, an emerging healthcare company, and i teach web development from time to time at ESIN.

I am passionate about the javascript ecosystem, and the quality management system as part of the web application production life cycle.
